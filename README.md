The [validator.nu][1] and [validator.w3.org/nu][2] services are built from code
hosted in a number of repos at [bitbucket.org/validator/][3]. Here at github,
there are read-only mirrors of those repos, as well as some [related HTML5 and
XHTML5 schemas][4], some [jar files][5], and a [validation how-to][6] that
explains various ways to do validation of HTML5 and XHTML5 documents.
